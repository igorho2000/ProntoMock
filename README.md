ProntoMock (henceforth referred to as `PM`) implements the core functionalities of popular online design tools such as `Canva` and `Figma`, providing users with a `familiar yet more streamlined experience`. This is the documentation and tutorial of PM, let's jump right in!

## Story and Motivation

In July, I was working on the Google UX Design Professional Certificate. As part of the curriculum, I learned to use popular online mockup software such as Figma and Adobe XD. I thought to myself then, `‚Äúhow hard would it be to code a graphics editor from scratch?‚Äù` As such, in August when I finished learning React and was looking for project ideas, creating a mockup editor kept popping into my head. 

With minimal fanfare, I began work on PM in mid-September. 1.5 months later, I‚Äôm pleased to announce that `ProntoMock v1.0 (Beta)` is complete. This version contains all basic functions expected from a mockup editor, the [complete list](#tutorial) could be found below.

This is, however, not the end of the development of PM. There are [dozens of more functions](#future-development) I aim at adding to the application to ensure PM is not only a cool project, but also a fully functional software that I myself would use on a daily basis.
